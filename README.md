# Animal-Sound-Classifier-using-Watson-Studio
Build classification models using IBM Watson Studio to predict (identify) animal sounds. Learn how to best gather and prepare data, create and deploy models, deploy and test a signal processing application, create models with binary classifications, and display the predictions on a web page created using Node-RED. 

This repo is based on the IBM Early Program - Animal Sound project. [Here.](https://github.com/bedangSen/animal-sounds)
